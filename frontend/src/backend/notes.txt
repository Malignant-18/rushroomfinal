I'll break down the architecture and data flow for RushRoom, a tourist-focused toilet finder app:

Data Structure:

1. Toilets Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- name with address
- place/town
- coordinates (lat/lng)
- free/paid
- opening_hours
- closing hours
- shower
- facilities (JSON: wheelchair, baby_change, sanitarypad)BOOLEAN
- average_rating
- image
- contact caretaker
- last Maintenance
- issues-raised(array of issues like no water  , no soap  , not cleaned)


2. Reviews Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- toilet_id (Foreign Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key)
- rating
- comment
- images
- created_at

Application Flow:

1. Main Page (/)
- Map centered on Kochi
- Filter sidebar (collapsible)
- Markers for each toilet
- Click marker â†’ small popup with basic info + "View Details" button
- Filter options affect visible markers in real-time

2. Toilet Detail Page (/toilet/:id)
- Full toilet information
- Photo gallery
- Opening hours
- Amenities list

API Endpoints:

1. Toilets:

2. Reviews:
- GET /api/toilets/:id/reviews
